# Static Website Deployment on AWS

This project demonstrates my ability to design, configure, and deploy a secure static website using AWS services.

## Project Overview
Deployed a static website on AWS with a custom domain managed through Route 53. Configured an S3 bucket for static hosting, applied secure access policies, and enabled SSL/TLS encryption using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). Integrated CloudFront for global content delivery, caching, and high availability to ensure optimal site performance.
